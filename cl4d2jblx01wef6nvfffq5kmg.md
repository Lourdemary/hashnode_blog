## Day 01  of 100 Days Of Code in Data Analytics : Microsoft Excel Fundamentals

Hello there, pals !

This is the first day of my #100DaysOfCode in Data Analytics. To be honest, I had no idea where to start with this challenge's tech stack. After that, I tweeted the same thing, and several aspiring data analysts advised me to start with Excel. As a result, I chose to begin with Microsoft Excel.

#### Excel , But why ?
Microsoft Excel is one of the most widely used data analysis programmes. They are without a doubt the most sought-after analytic tool accessible, as they come with built-in pivot tables. It's a one-stop data management solution that lets you import, examine, clean, analyse, and display your data with ease.

#### Here are a few things I've discovered:
> Excel User Interface

> Basic Formatting 

> Absolute vs Relative vs Mixed Cell Referencing

> Cell Modes

> Possible Data types

#### 1. Excel User Interface

- Ribbon tabs
- Name box
- Formula bar
- Columns
- Cells
- Rows
- Ribbon groups
- Ribbon controls
- Sheet tabs
- Split controls - Horizontal & Vertical
- Status bar
- Quick access toolbar
- Title bar


#### 2. Basic formatting 

| Shortcut key | |Description |
| --- | | --- |
| CTRL + B | |Applies **bold** format|
| CTRL + 1 | |Opens the Format Cells dialog box|
| CTRL + I | |Applies *Italic* format|
| CTRL + Shift + ~ | |Applies general format|
| CTRL + Shift + $ | |Applies currency format|
| CTRL + Shift + % | |Applies percent format|
| CTRL + Shift + ^ | |Applies scientific format|
| CTRL + Shift + # | |Applies date format|
| CTRL + Shift + @ | |Applies time format|
| CTRL + Shift + ! | |Applies number format|

#### 3. Absolute vs Relative vs Mixed cell referencing

|Referencing| |Description|
|---||---|
|Absolute reference||Fixing the value of a particular cell reference. Cell reference are preceded by $.|
|Relative reference||The referenced cells are moving down as formula moves down |
|Mixed cell reference||Only part of the reference is fixed, either the row or the column, and the other part is relative |

#### 4. Cell Modes

|Mode| |Description|
|---| |---|
|Ready||Default mode , when you are not doing anything |
|Enter| |The moment we begin typing text or value it automatically switches to enter mode|
|Point| |When begin with = or + or - sign, it switches to enter mode, pressing any of the arrow keys , it switches from enter mode to point mode|
|Edit| |If we return to a cell that contains data and press F2 or click in a formula bar, we are placed in edit mode|


#### 5. Possible data types

Excel continually analyses what you write and categorises it as one of three potential data types: text, value, or formula.

> 1. If Excel recognises an item as a formula, it calculates the formula automatically and shows the result in the worksheet column (you continue to see the formula itself, however, on the Formula bar).

> 2. If Excel detects that the item is not a formula, it assesses whether it should be categorised as text or a value.

Excel distinguishes between text and values in order to determine how to align the item in the worksheet. Text entries are aligned with the cell's left edge, whereas values are aligned with the cell's right edge.
